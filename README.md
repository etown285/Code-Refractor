# Code-Refractor

## Description 

The way that the previous Horiseon page was built did not follow the Americans with Disabilities Act accessibility guidelines. I have fixed the code to include semantic HTML elements and tags and organized the site's structure.  

### Change Overview

* Made titles more clear and concise with what content that is available on the page.  
* Changed the div class "header" to the semantic header element to follow page structure.
* Removed div and added the nav element for the navigation bar. 
* Removed div and class and added a figure to follow page structure. 
* Fixed image link for the background image in the figure section. 
* Replaced div and added section element with article elements for each description. 
* Replaced div and added aside article elements for service descriptions. 
* Corrected all element tags to match the correct style changes. 
* Created alt and title tags for all images with proper descriptions.
* Consolidated all CSS tags that had the same properties.
* Added appropriate comments to changes in CSS.
* Added appropriate comments to HTML changes.
